        <h1 id="apples-keynote">Apple's Keynote</h1>
        <p>When I'm on the verge of buying a Mac I tend to get a little obsessive. <a href="http://bobzrkr.org/">Erik</a>'s had to physically restrain me once or twice. So here's a telling of my favorite Mac presentation experience to help me vent.</p>
        <p>A presentation for a college class I was taking warranted a PowerPoint visual aid. Since everyone else was using one it would look half-assed if you didn't slap <em>something</em> together. PowerPoint is akin to a 60-year-old man who looks 100 due to years of smoking, malnutrition, and neglect. Also I honestly believe that for the public good Microsoft needs to hard-code a provision into the next version of PowerPoint explicitly disallowing the use of <a href="http://bancomicsans.com/">Comic Sans</a> in any presentation under any circumstances.</p>
        <p>Our teacher requested that anyone requiring the projector set up before class to minimize situations such as: &quot;Sorry everyone, I'm not sure what's ? let see ? it was working earlier ? well I guess I'll just have to reboot.&quot; After watching a myriad of uninspired, plain, illegible mockeries of color and form it came to be my turn. I stode to the front with my Powerbook in hand, lid closed, Apple logo facing the class, effortlessly hanging from it's industrial strength aluminum handle. Then I placed it on the table amidst the graveyard of plastic wintel laptops and opened the lid. In the second-and-a-half of time it took for the screen to light and the machine to wake I had plugged the projector into the VGA port. Another second-and-a-half and Keynote's opening slide appeared on the big-screen. I clicked play and we were off!</p>
        <p>This <a href="http://www.apple.com/keynote/">Keynote</a> presentation was comprised of a gorgeous Apple template; anti-aliased text and drop shadows where appropriate; dithered, variable, alpha-channel transparency for the graphics; and hardware-accelerated slide transitions both 2D and 3D.</p>
        <p>After it was finished, I unplugged the projector, closed the lid and the Powerbook was swiftly asleep and safe for transport. As I made my way back to my seat, leaving the unsightly wintel table alone with only the repugnant company of each other, one of the students spoke up, &quot;Hey was that that new Apple PowerPoint thing?&quot; I gave him a knowing, curt nod, &quot;Keynote? Yeah.&quot;</p>
        <p>I'd like to think that I really made a difference in a few people's lives that day. But maybe I'm just being <a href="http://www.despair.com/pretension.html">pretentious</a>. ;-)</p>
