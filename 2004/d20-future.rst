d20 Future book review
======================

For those of you who play Dungeons & Dragons, you may have heard about `d20
Modern`_, which brings the excellent and open `d20`_ rules that govern D&D v3.5
to the realistic present day. Well Wizards recently released a suppliment
called d20 Future which allows for adventures in any kind of possible future
setting you wish to concoct.

I am almost finished reading the book, and highly recommend picking it up if
you're more of a sci-fi RPGer than fantasy.

First you've got to love the d20 System; some of the cooler cyberpunk RPGs like
Shadowrun were almost unplayable due to agonizingly slow and poor combat rules.

Second, I really enjoy the tone of the book, it's set up as a fairly
comprehensive collection of rules for a variety of time periods and technology
levels instead of a self-contained campaign sourcebook. d20 Future leave a lot
of balance and other considerations to the GM appropriate to the particular
campaign.

Some things aren't perfect such as in the Robotics section, the need for sleep
isn't explained to my satisfaction nor is the robotic difficulty with hovering
in the age of flying cars and skateboards. More than likely, this is an attempt
at balance for Robotic PCs and can certainly be changed where pertinent.
