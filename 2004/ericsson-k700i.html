        <h1 id="sony-ericsson-k700i">Sony Ericsson K700i</h1>
        <p>Eager to have a mobile PIM in my pocket once again, and inspired by <a href="http://svg.org/special/svg_phones">SVG-T</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/bluetooth/">Bluetooth</a> I have purchased the <a href="http://developer.sonyericsson.com/site/global/products/phones/k700/p_k700.jsp">Sony Ericsson K700i</a>.</p>

        <p>It works fabulously with my Apple Powerbook. I'm able to synchronise my calendar and address book over Bluetooth, with only a <a href="http://www.esato.com/board/viewtopic.php?topic=61888&amp;start=45#post859904">few bugs</a> that are being worked out. I can use the phone as a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/jonassalling/Shareware/RemoteBasics/">remote control</a> for various applications which is proving to be very useful. And bravo to Ericsson for using an <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/SonyEricsson/HID%20Profiles">open standard</a> for putting together custom HID plugins. Lastly, Quicktime has a built-in export profile for 3G media files so getting video and audio in a size-appropriate format is a three-click maneuver.</p>
        <p>The little J2ME interpreter is pretty speedy for a phone, but unfortunately not fast enough to run a playable <a href="http://www.vampent.com/emu.htm">NES emulator</a>. I've got an SSH client on there, but at $0.03 per kilobyte of data transfer through AT&amp;T, I can't imagine I'll be using it much.</p>
        <p>It includes an FM radio since it's a trivial energy-drain on the battery, but the hands-free kit cords double as the antenna and won't work without which is a shame since they are constantly tangled. I intend on picking up a wireless Bluetooth headset soon. The white LED flash doubles as a decent flashlight, and the camera has a variety of effects available including a three-shot panoramic view.</p>
        <p>All the reviews I read claimed it gets horrendous battery life. I managed to drain a full charge in a little over twelve hours with heavy bluetooth usage, but when I just make a few calls and check the calendar once or twice I can stretch it out to at least two days, maybe three if I really took it easy.</p>
        <p>All things considered, the K700i is a fantastic phone with a great many features all packed into a little tiny case. It was definitely a good buy.</p>
