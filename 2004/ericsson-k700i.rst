Sony Ericsson K700i

Eager to have a mobile PIM in my pocket once again, and inspired by `SVG-T`_
and `Bluetooth`_ I have purchased the `Sony Ericsson K700i`_... image::

It works fabulously with my Apple Powerbook. I'm able to synchronise my
calendar and address book over Bluetooth, with only a `few bugs`_ that are
being worked out. I can use the phone as a `remote control`_ for various
applications which is proving to be very useful. And bravo to Ericsson for
using an `open standard`_ for putting together custom HID plugins. Lastly,
Quicktime has a built-in export profile for 3G media files so getting video
and audio in a size-appropriate format is a three-click maneuver.

The little J2ME interpreter is pretty speedy for a phone, but unfortunately
not fast enough to run a playable `NES emulator`_. I've got an SSH client on
there, but at $0.03 per kilobyte of data transfer through AT&T, I can't
imagine I'll be using it much.

It includes an FM radio since it's a trivial energy-drain on the battery, but
the hands-free kit cords double as the antenna and won't work without which
is a shame since they are constantly tangled. I intend on picking up a
wireless Bluetooth headset soon. The white LED flash doubles as a decent
flashlight, and the camera has a variety of effects available including a
three-shot panoramic view.

All the reviews I read claimed it gets horrendous battery life. I managed to
drain a full charge in a little over twelve hours with heavy bluetooth usage,
but when I just make a few calls and check the calendar once or twice I can
stretch it out to at least two days, maybe three if I really took it easy.

All things considered, the K700i is a fantastic phone with a great many
features all packed into a little tiny case. It was definitely a good buy.
