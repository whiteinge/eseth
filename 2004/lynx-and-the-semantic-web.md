# Can Lynx be used today?

There was [a post earlier this month on the Lynx-dev mailing
list](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lynx-dev/2004-08/msg00000.html) asking
whether Lynx was obsolete in this age of Flash, JavaScript and streaming-video.
It is not.

I've been working on a project for the last few days, converting a great deal
of flat text (approx. 2MB) to hyperlinked, standards-compliant, accessible
HTML. I've been doing this by hand, and if it weren't for [recording with
Vim](http://www.vim.org/tips/tip.php?tip_id=144), I think it would be near
impossible. This colossal text file has an abundance of tabular data and I have
been using Lynx to check my markup periodically. If you think Lynx is a dead
browser, you've another thing coming, it's still being developed approaching
the 2.9 release. In the tests I've done these few days with newer HTML 4.0
table elements such as thead, tbody and colgroup - Lynx, a text-based browser,
has done a better job rendering these standards-compliant tables than
[Firefox](http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=915)!

The inevitable coming of the Semantic Web will be a boon for Lynx. Not only is
Lynx not obsolete, I think it's most glorious days are ahead of it. Need proof?
Fire up Lynx and visit any blog, visit my site for certain, but for a real
treat visit [the new Chevrolet web site](http://www.chevrolet.com/). That's not
a text-version, or even a special version for text browsers - it's just
a regular standards-compliant site rendered without the associated style sheet.
Beautiful.
