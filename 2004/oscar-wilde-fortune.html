        <p>Oscar Wilde is the greatest author of all time. I can prove it.</p>
        <p>Besides playwriting, poetry, and the odd novel he is best known for his many quotations. It is said that if you are unsure of the origin of a quote you should attribute it to Wilde as he is the most likely to have coined it.</p>
        <p>I looked around for an existing collection of quotes and turned up only disappointment, so I painstakingly (please mail spelling error corrections directly to me!) crafted my own list of 257 favorites, slapped together a Makefile and README, and am now releasing the <a href="./wilde.tar.bz2">Oscar Wilde UNIX fortune cookie</a> for your local BSD Games installation.</p>
