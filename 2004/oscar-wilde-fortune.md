Oscar Wilde fortune cookie
==========================

Oscar Wilde is the greatest author of all time. I can prove it.

Besides playwriting, poetry, and the odd novel he is best known for his
many quotations. It is said that if you are unsure of the origin of a
quote you should attribute it to Wilde as he is the most likely to have
coined it.

I looked around for an existing collection of quotes and turned up only
disappointment, so I painstakingly (please mail spelling error
corrections directly to me!) crafted my own list of 257 favorites,
slapped together a Makefile and README, and am now releasing the [Oscar
Wilde UNIX fortune cookie](./wilde.tar.bz2) for your local BSD Games
installation.
