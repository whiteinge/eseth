Oscar Wilde is the greatest author of all time. I can prove it.

Besides playwriting, poetry, and the odd novel he is best known for his many
quotations. It is said that if you are unsure of the origin of a quote you
should attribute it to Wilde as he is the most likely to have coined it.

I looked around for an existing collection of quotes and turned up only
disappointment, so I painstakingly (please mail spelling error corrections
directly to me!) crafted my own list of 257 favorites, slapped together a
Makefile and README, and am now releasing the `Oscar Wilde UNIX fortune
cookie`_ for your local BSD Games installation.
