OS X vs. Linux and Linux on Laptops
===================================

Apple recently introduced a sub $1k
[iBook](http://www.apple.com/ibook/) so I've (almost) promptly put my
[Vaio on
eBay](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=6717542838).
Now this doesn't bode well for my emotional state as this will be the
fifth laptop I've purchased in the last two years.

Initially I purchased a 12" Powerbook to replace a tiny 300 MHz, 12"
ThinkPad. In all honesty I should've stopped there. Instead I got kind
of nuts when I saw the Powerbook could *almost* play Warcraft III, so
quickly returned it for a more powerfull 15" Powerbook.

I loved that 15". But ultimately I stopped carrying it around often
enough to justify owning a laptop because it was so heavy. Around then I
discovered the [Sharp Zaurus
C860](http://www.pdabuyersguide.com/sharp_zaurus_C860.htm), and believed
it to be capable of replacing a notebook. It wasn't; it did have the
battery-life of a laptop (doh!), but the Arm processor made it difficult
to find / compile software for it. In retrospect I wish I had tried
[distcc](http://freshmeat.net/projects/distcc/?branch_id=29642&release_id=175494)
before I sold it. It is possible that had I been more knowlegable about
Linux I could've made it work, but I doubt it -- there were a lot of
issues with the various distributions ([1](http://www.pdaxrom.org/),
[2](http://openzaurus.org/www/),
[3](http://my-zaurus.narod.ru/cacko.html)) available mostly relating to
yet-unsupported hardware and software unavailability.

Next I purchased a [Sony Vaio
Picturebook](http://eseth.com/filez/vaio/). Now I had always wanted one
of these -- I'm a *huge* fan of ultra-small laptops; the screen runs
at 1024x480, for example. And generally speaking I was very pleased with
it. In my sheltered Mac days I had assumed that Linux, since it is
virtually ready for prime-time on the desktop, could also be almost as
effective on a mobile device.

Linux on laptops sucks. Although, to be fair, I'm dying to see how it
performs on very supported hardware (as opposed to average hardware
--there's a company that sells laptops and desktop as well as offering
their own Linux distro in an attempt to bring the Mac experience to
Linux, but I couldn't find a link). And, again to be fair, my
Picturebook's hardware is all fully supported except for some ACPI
closed-bios issues (that are Sony and Microsoft's fault). Because Sony
implemented Microsoft's implementation of ACPI instead of the standard,
Linux is having some trouble with power-management, specifically
suspend. Although Linux's power-management in general needs a lot of
work, I was able to get suspend-to-disk working with the 2.6.7 kernel
which made things a lot nicer.

To sum up: Desktop Linux works very well because your computer never
goes anywhere, so you've got the time to get working whatever you need
it to do, and it stays working. But when you're mobile and run into
unexpected situations such as needing TV-or-VGA-out, [strict wireless
LAN requirements](http://wireless.utah.edu/global/dot1x/index.html)
you've *really* got a know your stuff, and it will still take a while
to set up.

So I'll be getting a 12" iBook. It's not a desktop replacement or for
gaming, my Linux desktop works very well for that. I'm sure it will be
fast-enough for my mobile needs, and it's a Mac so it will just work,
even in unexpected situations.
