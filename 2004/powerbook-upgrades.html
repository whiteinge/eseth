        <p>I got a new Mac.</p>
        <p>Well not really, but I thought it'd be funny given my somewhat <a href="http://eseth.org/archives/2004/10/26/os-x-vs-linux-and-linux-on-laptops/">less than decisive</a> history. I did, however, upgrade my RAM. from the stock 256 MB to 768 MB.</p>
        <p>Why Apple considers 256 MB of RAM acceptable for OS X I'll never understand, in fact, the minimum system requirements call for 128 MB (version 10.3). I have an old G3 iMac with 192 MB and the only thing it does these days is record TV. It'll run Safari and barely runs Microsoft Word, but I wouldn't call it usable. My new 12&quot; Powerbook came with 256 MB and couldn't really run anything without constantly paging-out. Forget quickly switching between a running Firefox and a running iTunes (not small programs) without accessing the disk, especially if you have a few tabs open in Firefox. Personally, I prefer using a remote Firefox over an SSH-forwarded X Windows in that situation and only using Safari to view the few types of multimedia that <a href="http://fredrik.hubbe.net/plugger.html">plugger</a> has problems with.</p>
        <p>Now that I'm running 768 MB it feels like a whole new machine. Switching between Firefox and iTunes is seamless (and I happen to be running the World of Warcraft installer as well). I'm certainly pickier than the average computer user, and probably <em>way</em> pickier than the average Mac user--I guess I just wish Apple's RAM wasn't so expensive when you're buying a new system.</p>
