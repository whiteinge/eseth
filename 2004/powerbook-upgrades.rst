==================
Powerbook Upgrades
==================

.. index:: computing, os x

I got a new Mac.

Well not really, but I thought it'd be funny given my somewhat `less than
decisive`_ history. I did, however, upgrade my RAM. from the stock 256 MB to
768 MB.

Why Apple considers 256 MB of RAM acceptable for OS X I'll never understand,
in fact, the minimum system requirements call for 128 MB (version 10.3). I
have an old G3 iMac with 192 MB and the only thing it does these days is
record TV. It'll run Safari and barely runs Microsoft Word, but I wouldn't
call it usable. My new 12" Powerbook came with 256 MB and couldn't really run
anything without constantly paging-out. Forget quickly switching between a
running Firefox and a running iTunes (not small programs) without accessing
the disk, especially if you have a few tabs open in Firefox. Personally, I
prefer using a remote Firefox over an SSH-forwarded X Windows in that
situation and only using Safari to view the few types of multimedia that
`plugger`_ has problems with.

Now that I'm running 768 MB it feels like a whole new machine. Switching
between Firefox and iTunes is seamless (and I happen to be running the World
of Warcraft installer as well). I'm certainly pickier than the average
computer user, and probably *way* pickier than the average Mac user--I guess
I just wish Apple's RAM wasn't so expensive when you're buying a new system.
