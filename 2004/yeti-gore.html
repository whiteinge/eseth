        <h1 id="yeti-gore-flash-game">Yeti Gore Flash game</h1>
        <p>Here's a little <a href="http://www.yonkis.com/mediaflash/yeti_gore.htm">penguin batting practice</a> game. This site is <em>not</em> safe for work (NSFW)! However, the game itself is clean because:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Remember what the MPAA says: Horrific, deplorable violence is okay, as long as people don't say any naughty woids!</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Quick tangent: Macromedia really needs to overhaul their Linux and Mac Flash players. They both have <em>huge</em> lack-of-performance issues, but the Mac player is almost unusable. Often times sites with Flash ads will bring my 1.33 GHz Powerbook to it's knees and I struggle to scroll the window down with 100% CPU utilization.</p>
        <p>The Linux player specifically has massive sound latency issues. Maybe the Linux community wouldn't bad-mouth Flash so much if we weren't continually embarrassed in front of our Windows friends every time we try to show them the latest <a href="http://www.jibjab.com/">JibJab</a> cartoon and the audio can't stay synced for the 90-second duration. This Flash game in particular is very difficult to play because if your sound is enabled it will cause the player to skip as you're trying to bat. It played very smoothly on my friends' 1 GHz Windows laptop.</p>
        <p>Macromedia, if you're thinking about <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5170061.html">pledging solid Linux support</a>, then please, please start with the Flash player!</p>

        <dd><p>If you've been around, then you'll remember that each recent generation of the Macromedia Flash Player has had extra Mac-specific engineering done for performance optimization. One of the big gates, though, is the way that processor cycles are distributed among guest processes in browsers? you can often see big differences between standalone playback and in-browser playback. It's still an ongoing goal, but there are major roadblocks in the way.</p>
        <p>If you're seeing 100% CPU utilization with ad-heavy pages, then from what I've seen this is most frequently caused by designers who choose excessively high framerates. Disney worked well with 12fps? requesting more frames-per-second than the hardware can deliver is a sure way to choke off the machine's overall interactivity.</p>
        <p>For Linux it's different -- here the top request seems to be &quot;create engines which run on more Linux flavors, in more browser configurations&quot;. Of course, there are many requests for authoring tools too, but I haven't seen recent analysis on how much money this might actually return? Codeweavers is the best bet here now.</p>
