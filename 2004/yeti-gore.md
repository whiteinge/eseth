Yeti Gore Flash game
====================

Here's a little [penguin batting
practice](http://www.yonkis.com/mediaflash/yeti_gore.htm) game. This
site is *not* safe for work (NSFW)! However, the game itself is clean
because:

> long as people don't say any naughty woids!

Quick tangent: Macromedia really needs to overhaul their Linux and Mac
Flash players. They both have *huge* lack-of-performance issues, but the
Mac player is almost unusable. Often times sites with Flash ads will
bring my 1.33 GHz Powerbook to it's knees and I struggle to scroll the
window down with 100% CPU utilization.

The Linux player specifically has massive sound latency issues. Maybe
the Linux community wouldn't bad-mouth Flash so much if we weren't
continually embarrassed in front of our Windows friends every time we
try to show them the latest [JibJab](http://www.jibjab.com/) cartoon and
the audio can't stay synced for the 90-second duration. This Flash game
in particular is very difficult to play because if your sound is enabled
it will cause the player to skip as you're trying to bat. It played
very smoothly on my friends' 1 GHz Windows laptop.

Macromedia, if you're thinking about [pledging solid Linux
support](http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5170061.html), then please,
please start with the Flash player!
