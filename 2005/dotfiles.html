        <h1 id="dotfiles">Dotfiles</h1>
        <p>I've long enjoyed painstakingly constructing dotfiles or *rc files for various programs I use frequently. They allow such exact configuration and are so portable between systems. <a href="../2006/firefox-boxen-hopping.html">If only Firefox worked so simply</a>.</p>
        <p>Here are some of mine:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Zsh is an amazing shell. It has unbelievable completion abilities, and is just gorgeous (pictured). I enjoy Vi-mode in my shells and <a href="https://github.com/whiteinge/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc">my zshrc has a Vi-style mode display</a> that I cobbled together from a few examples on the 'net. It also includes a small shell-function called <a href="https://github.com/whiteinge/dotfiles/blob/6a2377c/.zshrc#L228">dotsync</a> that keeps the rest of these dotfiles current.</li>
        <li>I've spent days of my life fine-tuning the <a href="https://github.com/whiteinge/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc">best goddamn vimrc in the whole world</a>. Parts of it are very much tailored to me, but I've tried to comment all my reasons for each option.</li>
        <li>GNU screen brings tabs and resume-able sessions to your command-line work, this utility is too useful to overlook. <a href="https://github.com/whiteinge/dotfiles/blob/master/.screenrc">My screenrc file illustrates tabs</a> as best as possible (pictured).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There's no reason you should work with an ugly terminal. It's 2005, your computer can handle it. And nothings beats sitting down at a new computer and typing <code>dotsync</code> to have your shell, editor, and browser preferences and bookmarks instantly configured just they way you like 'em. :-)</p>

        <p>Update 2009-12-16</p>
        <p>I have long-since switched from the home-rolled dotsync() to keeping my *rc files under version control.</p>
