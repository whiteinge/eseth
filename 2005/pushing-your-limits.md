Pushing your limits
===================

This is a must-read for any web developer interested in using CSS for
layout for some simple explanations (with pictures!) and a pretty decent
and quick overview of a lot of advanced CSS-layout topics.

Specifically pay attention to the Absolute/relative Positioning,
Double-Rollovers, Faux-columns and, Sliding Doors methods. It starts a
little slow, but go with it (and play with the examples).

On a side-note: at first I didn't pay much attention to the
CSS-slide-shows-instead-of-PowerPoint, but it's really starting to grow
on me. This presentation doesn't use it, but Erik Meyer has an
excellent packaged solution to putting together your own
[CSS-Presentations](http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/s5-intro.html).
Go through the first few slides at least to get a feel for the
functionality, then Print-Preview the presentation. Gorgeous.
