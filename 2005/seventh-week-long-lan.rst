Seventh Annual Week-Long LAN Party
==================================

This year's Week-Long was one of the best in recent years, I've moved this
page to a blog entry to preserve it and get it out of the way.

Dates and Location
------------------

This year's Week-Long LAN Party will be held from *June 22* to *June 26th*.
If you need directions you're not invited.

The following schedule merely formalizes activities during the peak hours of
6pm–11pm. Gaming will likely commence from noon until whenever people want
to quit for the day, and will be less formal for non-peak hours.

Weds Set up and troubleshooting DotA tutorial (for the interested) *6pm–11pm:

Barbeque
--------

We will have a barbeque to kick off Friday evening. In order to participate
you *must* submit $10 to Master Chef Gatt by Thursday. If we are able to get
more than twleve people (ideally fourteen or fifteen) we will get an entire
rib eye from Costco. Let's make this happen; start saving your money now.


Food

Light snacks and candy and hallucinatory Redvines will be provided. You are
responsible for your own meals! There will be a microwave, Foreman Grill,
fridge, and sink available.


Games

In an effort to reduce down-time, you *must* have the following games
installed, patched, and not pirated before you arrive at the party. Use
Windows, run Windows Update and make sure you're using the latest drivers for
your hardware. Broken people will not be pitied. Expect the Asshole Police to
verify your setup before the week of the party.

Seth
    First idea for discussion: Tribes: Vengeance
    http://gamespot.com/pc/action/tribesvengeance/

    None of us have ever played a Tribes game, dispite a pretty rabid cult
    following. That means no familiarity with maps, weapons, and whathaveyou.
    Eye-ball the Gamespot video review
    http://gamespot.com/pc/action/tribesvengeance/media.html. We could alll
    pick it up for $20 http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/product/235213.asp (or maybe
    less locally). However, maybe that's too much for a game we'll likely never
    play after the party.

    Second idea for discussion: Star Wars: Battlefront
    http://gamespot.com/pc/action/starwarsbattlefront/

    Battlefield 1942 made a pretty decent impression on everyone at a previous
    LAN. Star Wars: Battlefront is the exact same game, but Star Wars.

    Third idea for discussion: Defense of the Ancients http://www.dota-allstars.com/

    DotA, a Warcraft III mod, can be spectacularly fun but has a steep learning
    curve. It's likely that through the course of the week we'll have enough
    people to flesh out a whole team. We can have printed quick reference sheets
    available which will greatly help with familiarity.

Seth
    I have recieved a request for the complete and total lack of dungeon
    crawlersand MMORPGs. A counter idea I heard would be to set aside certain
    days of the party for certain games so you would know what to expect
    before-hand.

    *Make yourselves heard!*

Seth
    Food is another issue that creates a lot of downtime and dissension. Would
    everyone be ok with a door charge? If so, what kinds of food would everyone
    want? Peanut butter and jelly? Frozen burritos and ramen? What else? We
    could have a microwave downstairs.

Tzeench
    Let me be the first non-Seth person to applaud the noble efforts of
    efficiency (but not spelling, on my part). Hear, hear!

    I vote that people eat beforehand and/or bring their own food; much time
    can be wasted running around and picking up fast food. If we have a Grocer,
    like Seth, we should definately have a door charge for the food. Last time
    we did this, very few people paid him back and that was total bullshit.
    Money up front.

    I think Gatt's idea of certain days being flagged as ok for certain
    contentious game types (dungeon crawl, RTS, etc) is good. People can skip
    those days if they work or have shit to do and don't like what's on the
    menu.

    I want to hear what people think of various FPS modes, especially UT '04.
    We tend to do CTF on like 4 maps for 14 hr. when we do it, which gets
    tiresome. I'm game for Double Domination, Onslaught, Instagib CTF, Team
    Deathmatch and Bombing Run. Am I the only one who wants to play these?

    For Dugeon Crawl Day (if it ends up existing), we should do 1-2 instances
    in WoW. Mauradon and the Sunken Temple have been suggested. Anyone
    interested in those, or have other ideas?

    For food, everything Seth said sounds good. Frozen pizzas also sound good.
    We could actually (gasp and shock!) cook a butt-ton of pasta and ground
    hamburger (1/2 assed meatballs) or sausage (turkey, for Gatton) to put in
    it. It would be more work but yummier. If that sounds like a disaster
    waiting to happen, let's not do it.

    The games above look good to me, I have no problems with any of them. If
    some people want to do regular Warcraft Arranged Team that might be fun, or
    we could fight each other. Also, my posse liked Rise of Nations well
    enough, so if you have that bring it just in case the mood strikes during
    RTS Day.

    That's all I got for now. Let's rock the party.

Faggot Ass Nigger
    Tzeentch and i have randomly decided we want to play this game
    http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/damewasloaded/
    
Luke
    I'm definitely in a Dota way these days; you probably won't get me for
    anything else.
    
Brandon
    I for one am really looking forward to trying out Tribes: Vengence. From
    what I know of the tribes games, they have a much larger strategic element
    than most run and gun FPSs, but still play fast like UT. The system reqs
    won't kill us, and I think $20 isn't a bad investment.

    SW: Battlefront would be a good time, I think, but I'm not sure that we
    should try for both it and Tribes. The $50 price tag is the kicker there. I
    can see myself playing tribes after the party, but Battlefront would
    probably just collect dust.

    DotA is a given. I like the game, and It'll probably make a great
    side-game. Moonbase Commander is another great side-game.

    What we're lacking is a good cooperatlive game. The problem with those is
    that you need the same people around every time you continue. If anyone can
    think of any good ones, though, I'd love to hear about it.

    It hasn't been mentioned here yet, so I thought that I'd talk about a
    Firefly screening. Seth and I have been planning on watching all 14
    episodes, in the weeks before the release of Serenity (the Firefly movie).
    We thought the LAN party might be a good place to start with the pilot.

    If you havn't seen any Firefly yet, just know that its a great sci-fi
    television series. I'd like to hear what people think about watching the
    pilot, and maybe a couple more episodes.

Seth
    Firefly, yeah definitely.

    I'd like it to be more than just downtime filler too (again, if people are
    interested), it'd be nice to spend two or three hours one night, or maybe
    an hour a night.

    If you haven't seen 'em you're in for a treat. It's Joss Wheadon writing
    though so in order to appreciate it you have to pay attention (ie. we
    couldn't play and watch).

Big Daddy Gatt
    Planning for food is definately a good plan, i've also talked to seth about
    a possible BBQ on Friday, the menu would be some seriously tasty steaks
    from Costco. If we are interested enough to get a pot of $ going for food
    we could feasibly get Ribeyes for everyone if all that are interested will
    chip in 7 or 8 bucks. If you have not had a costco ribeye i strongly
    recommend taking advantage of this opportunity bitches, I will play grill
    master so y'all can game until it's ready then we'll all go in the yard and
    get our grub on, if you are interested call my cell phone and leave a
    message, or text me or send me some WoW mail, i'd really like to get this
    going it would be a nice change from the totaly shit we'll be eating the
    rest of the week. Also i don't know how it could have gone unsaid, but we
    need Redvines, and belive me we will have a costco tub of them.

    I definately don't want to buy any 50$ games and i doubt i'm alone on this,
    if we can use 'alternate methods' to cop SW then i'm down i think it will
    be fun. I believe Harrigan is working on a solution as i type this.

    DotA will be TONS of fun so i'm really looking forward to this.

    As far as co-op goes i think the best thing would be WoW for most of us,
    sunken temple would be good, also some of us still have *cough* Uldaman to
    worry about.

    UT is a given, i'm am happy to play most game types.

    Q3 also has some wicked fun DM.

    If my availability comes into question i should have thursday through
    saturday off.

    'I got the magic stick, i know if i can hit once, i can hit twice'.'50 cent
    (in reference to the BDG)

Faggot Ass Nigger
    I agree with Red Vines. If any of you dicklickers try to push those douchy
    gummy bears down our gullets again, i will fist your mothers until she has
    knuckles for teeth.

    Oh, and yes, Firefly is cool.

Faggot Ass Nigger
    DotA as a 'side-game' Brandon' Surely you jest. Front and fucking center.

    When you all say a 'cooperative' game, do you mean like an RPG? I mean, all
    of these team games are cooperative?. Are you looking for something that
    saves your progress from day to day and progresses, like Serious Sam or
    Dungeon Seige?

Faggot Ass Nigger
    For the record, the last post was not me. some stupid imposter who writes
    like Seth aparently.

Seth
    Sorry for the impersonation. You have to admit that was a pretty good Seth
    pretending to be Joe pretending to be Seth, though.

    By cooperative I think we mean Serious Sam-ish cooperative single player.
    With some of the games like DotA and SW: Battlefield if we're all on the
    same side then it accomplishes what we're hoping for. With Tribes or UT
    we'll only be fighting (sometimes gay) bots or each other.

    Incidentally, there's a Serious Sam 2 in the works due out this Fall or
    Winter, so plan on a celebratory LAN party just for that.

bobzrkr
    For all of you who want to play Tribes, I've found it for $17.50
    http://www.newegg.com/OldVersion/app/ViewProductDesc.asp'description=32-202-007&depa=6
    plus shipping.

    Another option I would like to all to consider is this
    http://www.newegg.com/OldVersion/app/viewproductdesc.asp?description=32-128-127&DEPA=6,
    I've heard Deathmatch on it is really fun. The game is only $30, and
    there's a fair amount of mods for it.

bobzrkr
    and obviously I don't know how to code html? Seth, Could you fix that last
    post for me? maybe? please? the other game I wanted ya'll to consider wat
    Half-Life 2, which is only $30.

    *Seth edit*: np, buddy. Halflife 2 for $30 really isn't bad at all. I'm
    sure I'd get around to it at some point, maybe this is a good opportunity.
    How does everyone else feel about it? BoB, what kind of multiplayer
    (non-mod and with-mod) options are available? Other than Counter Strike
    Source I mean.

bobzrkr
    Goddamnit I fucking hate motherfucking donkey raping piece of shit windows
    2000? After installing 42 critical update for windows 2000, the damn thing
    died.

Faggot Ass Nigger
    Bob, you may be interested in this site: www.i'mafuckingcrybabypussy.com

Seth
    There will be a meeting at the pad at 21:00 today (Tuesday) to discuss
    specifics and barbeque.

Meeting Update
--------------

The meeting went well, I think we covered most everything. The above page has
been updated to reflect the decisions made.

New Game Idea
-------------

How would everyone feel about resurecting Savage http://www.s2games.com/savage/
? Last Week Long we tried an /early/ build and did not have many people
playing, the game is much better now and we could get a pretty big game going
if we focused our efforts. Featuring both RTS and FPS elements, it has the
potential to really make this party. It's available from the official site for
a $20 downloadable version.

Big Daddy Gatt
    I think that savage would be a really good idea, this game is seriously fun
    and if we have the people power for it, it could easily dominate this lan
    party in the fashion of the original UT or Serious Sam in years past.
    Please try to get some feedback posted either positive or negative on this
    one so we can get this going.

Smudo
    Thanks for the invite *bitch!* Not that I would have gone anyway, I'll be
    at eBay Live in San Jose. But I totally would have gone if you had asked?
    except for, oh yeah right, who the crap plays games? What are all of you,
    12 year olds?

    (I'm not talking about you though big Gatt, I'd take your adorable little
    figure bent over a barrel ;-)

Seth
    A cool thing about Gatt's massive wang is you don't have to bend him over
    anything, you can just bend him over himself!

Tzeentch
    Savage, eh? I liked that game the first 2 times we tried it, but i agree
    that its Early Build Quotient was somewhere between lame and horrible.
    Melee combat was a joke, only humans were playable ? the whole game felt
    unpolished, unbalanced, and harder than it needed to be to do simple things
    (can i get a 'hell yeah' for idle workers not being shown, repairing
    requiring you to hit the attack button 600 times, poor item funtionality in
    many cases, and uninformative rollover text?).

    But i really liked the idea of Savage. It seemed like a dream come true for
    LAN parties, what with the multiple elements involved. If the game doesn't
    suck anymore, i'd play.

Faggot Ass Nigger
    Hell yeah.
    
Turbo
    Count me in on friday for food. Let me know if I can bring anything.

Lu
    I'm just a nobody who stumbled on the site, and obviously I am not part of
    your l33t circle, but i gotta say this lan party is the most outrageous
    geek- fest i've ever seen.

    You might want to throw ina game of ultimate or something in there, i mean
    just sanity's sake.

    Game on.!
