Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) Bug Review
================================

Lotta reviews of OS 10.4 floating around these last few days. Instead of
reporting all the things you've read (or don't care about) again here,
I've decided to post a review of all the bugs I've encountered with 10.4
since it was released. In an effort to minimize non-OS bugs the only
third-party software I'm currently running is the excellent [Menu Meters](http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/) which claims to
be 10.4-ready.

iSync 2.0 (78)
--------------

One of the things I was most looking forward to with Tiger was improved
Bluetooth support as well as an improved iSync since I use both to keep
my address book and calendar on my cell phone. On the very first sync
Tiger replaced all the address book entries in my cell phone with the
two entries (myself and Apple) on my computer. Since then Bluetooth has
been very flakey, sometimes seeing my phone, othertimes not.

Incidentally, if you know my cell phone number I'd appreciate it if you
could call me so I can start reassembling my social life.

Thanks, Apple.

Custom number formats
---------------------

When customizing my preferred number format (CCYYMMDD) in the
/International/ section of the /System Preferences/ I found that I'm
able to customize either everything but the /short/ format or nothing
except the /short/ format. Extremely annoying.

X11
---

When cmd-tabbing between running applications often X11 won't bring it's
windows to the foreground, forcing me to use Expose to get back to what
I was working on.

wget vs curl
------------

Not really a bug or a complaint, but I thought it was interesting that
Apple included curl but not the ubiquitos wget in the base OS.

Tiger is not completely bug-ridden, these are just a few examples I
noticed while messing around. So far I've been enjoying most of the
additions to my primary operating system, and am looking forward to the
first patch.

*Update* 2005-09-07: Finally! They've released an iSync update today
that has fixed the K700i. A four-month turn around is pretty horrible.
But, hey, I can start syncing my calendar again!
