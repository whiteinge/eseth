Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) Bug Review
================================

.. index:: computing, os x

:pubdate: 2005-05-04

Lotta reviews of OS 10.4 floating around these last few days. Instead of
reporting all the things you’ve read (or don’t care about) again here,
I’ve decided to post a review of all the bugs I’ve encountered with 10.4
since it was released. In an effort to minimize non-OS bugs the only
third-party software I’m currently running is the excellent Menu Meters
<http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/> which claims to be
10.4-ready.


iSync 2.0 (78)
==============

One of the things I was most looking forward to with Tiger was
improved Bluetooth support as well as an improved iSync since I use
both to keep my address book and calendar on my cell phone. On the
very first sync Tiger replaced all the address book entries in my
cell phone with the two entries (myself and Apple) on my computer.
Since then Bluetooth has been very flakey, sometimes seeing my
phone, othertimes not.

Incidentally, if you know my cell phone number I’d appreciate it if
you could call me so I can start reassembling my social life.

Thanks, Apple.

Custom number formats
=====================

When customizing my preferred number format (CCYYMMDD) in the
/International/ section of the /System Preferences/ I found that I’m
able to customize either everything but the /short/ format or
nothing except the /short/ format. Extremely annoying.

X11
===

When cmd-tabbing between running applications often X11 won’t bring
it’s windows to the foreground, forcing me to use Expose to get back
to what I was working on.

wget vs curl
============

Not really a bug or a complaint, but I thought it was interesting
that Apple included curl but not the ubiquitos wget in the base OS.

Tiger is not completely bug-ridden, these are just a few examples I
noticed while messing around. So far I’ve been enjoying most of the
additions to my primary operating system, and am looking forward to the
first patch.

*Update* 2005-09-07: Finally! They’ve released an iSync update today
that has fixed the K700i. A four-month turn around is pretty horrible.
But, hey, I can start syncing my calendar again!

    I saw that you posted again. Has it really been six months already? Wow,
    the time really flies by when one is busy. I eagerly await your next post.
    It will be October, right?

whiteinge
    Ahahahahahaahahaha! Very funny.

    This wouldn’t be a big issue for you if you’d just start using a goddamn
    news aggregator <http://www.hebig.org/blogs/archives/main/000877.php>. Then
    when there’s new content you see it and when there’s not you don’t need to
    keep checking back. Also when an old story is updated or someone posts a
    comment you’ll be notified. Like magic!

    In the words of Stewie Griffin
    <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0182576/quotes#qt0111858>, “I don’t need to
    fucking impress you.”

    What’s the big deal with Spotlight? Microsoft and Apple are making this out
    to be some amazing new thing. I was doing this in BeOS a decade ago
    <http://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=128854&cid=10753579> (seriously,
    ten freaking years ago). The guy that did it for Be is now doing it for
    Apple <http://www.nobius.org/~dbg/>. Don’t get me wrong, I sorely miss The
    One True Operating System and it’s good to have one of it’s cooler features
    back in my life, but these two companies need to stop complaining that the
    one is copying the other!

Matt Says:
    So, ten freaking years ago you were, like, 12? ;-)

    But seriously I wish I had the fortitude to have tiger become my primary
    OS. It probably could at home since all I have been playing is WoW…but at
    work, we’re a slave to the microshaft store.

    that is all.

Jason Wessel Says:
    Hey asshole! I don’t have to take this abuse! I do have an RSS feed to your
    sight. An RSS feed that hasn’t changed much in the last few months.

    I know with some blogs, like Poppy Z, Brite’s, if I don’t turn my computer
    on for a few days there are about ten new entrys. With yours, I can check
    once a month, and still not be surprised if I am staring at “WoW Hunter
    Macros” or “Unobtrusive JavaScript Gems” One would almost think that you
    had better ways to spend your time, like school or work or with a
    girlfriend. Your pathetic!

whiteinge
    Beeeep! Thanks for playing.

    News aggregators aggregate RSS (and other) feeds all in one place. Try one,
    I think you’ll like it. Bloglines <http://bloglines.com/> is web-based so
    you won’t even have to install anything.

    I get most of my news from BBC since traditional domestic sights seem to be
    obsessed with senseless bullshit like Micharel Jackson and who Brad Pitt is
    dating. (if you REALLY followed my blog you would know that from my weird
    battle with the Catholic fundamentalist from Texas) Unfortunately, for
    topical stuff I am interested in sights like
    http://www.albawaba.com/ar/main// and http://www.albawaba.com/ or for
    entertainment news http://www.cinescape.com, there are no news aggregators
    or fancy crap for these sights. Your setup is not keeping you ahead of the
    curve. How many times have I forwarded something that was new to you
    despite your aggregator? For, example, this is a few days old, but are you
    aware of Spike TV planning a Blade TV show?

    If not, so there!

    If you do know about it, Fuck you and your hippy shit! I hope you die!

    I know BBC is state run but it is the best news in the world right now. It
    is dense but at least it covers the relevent material. I will stick with it
    despite the lack of an aggregator. If I want to follow the sex life of
    Colin Ferril or Tom Cruise I promise I will sign up to whatever you want.
    Until that day arrives, let me gather my news through sources I trust to
    waste my time.

    I do need to free up time for underground gay midget porn.

JonsY Says:
    Jason’s right, PussHound! Why do you even bother keeping a blog when you
    update is so infrequently!

whiteinge <http://eseth.org/> Says:
    You started out so well I was actually going to admit defeat, but you dug
    your own grave <http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/help/rss/3223484.stm> on this
    one, buddy!

    Victory is mine! <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0182576/quotes#qt0157216>

whiteinge
    Oh, and who the fuck is JonsY, anyway?

JonsY Says:
    have you read jason’s blog? his rocks, you should read it sometime… his is
    interesting!... meanwhile your’s is still sucking! Jason, you rock!

Smudo <http://ejoshua.com> Says:
    I didn’t realize you still used a mac… good on ya! (i posted this from my
        phone while sitting on the toilet.)

Johnny Says:
    Nice to see a serious problem like loss of contacts get such professional
    responses. I had the same problem with my Palm -all addresses gone except
    me and Apple (I’ve since deleted the Apple entry). Luckily my Linux box had
    a backup. No other info on this??

whiteinge
    Johnny,

    Professional indeed. Thanks for the note though, that’s interesting to hear
    it happened with Palm too. I haven’t looked for any other occurances or a
    solution, iSync still can’t see my phone via Bluetooth, instead I’ve simply
    stopped backing up my phone. :-(
