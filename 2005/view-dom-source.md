Viewing the DOM Source with Firefox
===================================

I\'ll be the first to admit that blogging about not-so-obvious features
in software isn\'t always cool, unless that happens to be [your
thing](http://www.macosxhints.com/). However, I somehow missed this
(almost) amazing functionality in Firefox until just now.

When modifying the Document Object Model (DOM) with Javascript or
ECMAScript it can be frustrating trying to visualize the difference in
page structure between what the browser ultimately sees and renders, and
what the unmodified \'View Source\' function shows you. There have been
[Bookmarklets](http://www.nczonline.net/archive/2005/3/140) that do the
job, however Firefox has the ability to do this natively.

When you highlight something in a page, right-click that selection and
click \'View Selection Source\'. Voila, you have the ability to view the
modified DOM source!

Ideally Firefox should have another button for the DOM source without
you having to highlight everything, but this does give you the ability
to highlight only the portion of the page you\'re interested in. Also, I
don\'t know why this isn\'t an option in the otherwise amazing [Web
Developer
toolbar](https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&id=60).

Thanks to Jeremy Fujimoto-Johnson for pointing this out in a comment on
the above-linked NCZOnline site.

*Update* 2006-01-05: Hooray! The just-updated version of the Web
Developer toolbar greatly improved all menus including a new \"View
Generated Source\" function.

:   I never knew that. Now it will be 100 times easier to write my AJAX
    apps. Thanks!

:   You may be interested in the fairly new extension FireBug. It has
    nice DOM browsing functionality and shows a decent view of the DOM
    source.
