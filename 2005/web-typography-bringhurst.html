        <p>Richard Rutter of <a href="http://www.clearleft.com/">Clearleft</a> has recently started a project entitled <a href="http://webtypography.net/">The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web</a>. This looks like a great and much-needed project which needs much more exposure than it has been getting. Typography on the web is still in its infancy and often completely ignored, projects like this may finally make the web a pleasant place to read.</p>
        <p>You can read the announcement and leave comments on the <a href="http://www.clagnut.com/blog/1600/">author's personal blog</a> (?).</p>
        <p>On a side note, I really enjoy his use of <a href="http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/selectors_adjacent.htm">Adjacent Sibling Selectors</a>, currently unsupported in Internet Explorer, to indent sub-paragraphs:</p>
        <pre><code>p + p {
            margin-top: 0;
            text-indent: 1.5em;
        }</code></pre>

        <dd><p>Most excellent!</p>
        <p>I have actually used the aforementioned CSS to indent sub-paragraphsâ€”very cool.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I would like to dedicate some effort to studying the arcane art of CSS.</p>
