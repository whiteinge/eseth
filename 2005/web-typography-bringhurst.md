Web Typography, Bringhurst-style
================================

Richard Rutter of [Clearleft](http://www.clearleft.com/) has recently
started a project entitled [The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to
the Web](http://webtypography.net/). This looks like a great and
much-needed project which needs much more exposure than it has been
getting. Typography on the web is still in its infancy and often
completely ignored, projects like this may finally make the web a
pleasant place to read.

You can read the announcement and leave comments on the [author\'s
personal blog](http://www.clagnut.com/blog/1600/) (?).

On a side note, I really enjoy his use of [Adjacent Sibling
Selectors](http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/selectors_adjacent.htm),
currently unsupported in Internet Explorer, to indent sub-paragraphs:

    p + p {
        margin-top: 0;
        text-indent: 1.5em;
    }
