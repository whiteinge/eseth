Back from Brazil
================

We're back from Brazil and had a fabulous time. Thais' family is awesome and
that country is just gorgeous. I haven't been terribly social since our return,
I apologize! I uploaded pictures of the honeymoon, reception, and wedding to
the `new photo gallery`_.

`Nat`_ mailed me wondering "Where on `Google Earth`_ Are You?" and I had so
much fun looking over all the places we visited that I put Google Earth links
below if you care to see them.

Thais is from the southern-most state in Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul, which is
`heavily populated by German immigrants`_. Her parents are living in a little
town named `Harmonia <./Harmonia.kmz>`_ |ge|, population 2,000, which is 90%
German-speaking. The townsfolk are largely farmers or factory workers and are
pretty suspicious of strangers. We were visiting during an annual town
celebration (pictured), announced by a loud- speaker on a car that drove around
for a week beforehand, and the people were much more sociable then. I was
approached a number of times and had to respond that I did not speak
Portuguese, and every time was asked, "Oh, then do you speak German?" The
`gaucho`_ (people from southern Brazil) music and folk dancing are very
derivative of German folk music and dancing.

Rio Grande do Sul is famous for shoes, furniture, and chocolate that are
exported all over the world. We visited another German town called
`Novo Hamburgo <./NovoHamburgo.kmz>`_ |ge| ('Novo' means 'New')
specifically to buy new shoes - we weren't disapointed with the selection. :-)

`Gramado <./Gramado.kmz>`_ |ge| (pictured), similarly, is famous for chocolate. The
town is very reminiscent of Park City - but German-er - complete with high,
touristy, prices; a film festival; cold weather and high altitude.

A few times a week we'd make the hour-and-a-half drive into the capital city of
Rio Grande do Sul, `Porto Alegre <./PortoAlegre.kmz>`_ |ge|. for
shopping and business. Thais' family recycles plastics so I got to tour a
couple plastic factories, one of which makes the plastic for the soles of
(famous) shoe brands. It was very cool to see.

To finish the trip we spent only a couple days in `Rio de Janeiro
<RiodeJaneiro.kmz>` |ge| The city is very beautiful, but many parts are very
impovershed and dangerous. The largest slum we drove past spanned the entire
side of a mountain and is populated by 80,000 people. The famous beaches there,
Copacabana and Ipanema, we're pretty gorgeous and warm even though we visited
in the late fall. The big Jesus statue, `Cristo Redentor
<./CristoRedentor.kmz>`_ |ge| (pictured) that looks over the city was pretty
awesome, and visible from almost everywhere. (The Google Earth topographical
data for Rio de Janeiro seems suspect to me, the mountain that the statue sits
atop is much more dramatic in person.) Next visit we'd like to spend more time
there to see the (seemingly) countless statues and monuments we drove past.
