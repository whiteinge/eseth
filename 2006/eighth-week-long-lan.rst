    Not to be nit-picky, but arent weeks normally seven days long?

    Dota UT Doom III if its burnable Some crazy new game that one random person
    heard something good about, but turns out to be buggy and shitty, but still
    fun since its all of us suffering together.

whiteinge
    Yeah, but Eighth Annual Work-Week-Long LAN Party has too many hyphens.

Thais
    About the menu - since now I am "the wife", I volunteer to cook for you
    gamers on Thursday the 22nd, I could prepare home made italian food.
    
Smudo
    um?. since there's going to be "wives" there? does that mean that we won't
    have, well, um?. "adult entertainers" there this year???

Thais
    Hey? I can be the "adult entertainer" this year.

whiteinge
    Wooooooooot!

    So, I hear that some version of Tribes has been made available (thanks to
    Jason). Can you give us some details, Seth?

whiteinge
    No love. Tribes needs to be activated online, so if we want it we'll all
    have to shell out $20 - which probably means no Tribes again this year. I
    installed the demo to check it out, it looks pretty solid. :-(

    Just have my daughter sell her inner organs. That's what good Brazilian wives do.

    Actually, scratch that. I just bought a CD off eBay. Hopefully it'll get
    here before Thursday and hopefully it'll be burnable / gamedrive- able.

whiteinge
    Ok so, woot!, it's no-cd crack-able. Now we need to test it for multiple
    clients on one serial - I need a volunteer to help me out.

    I look forward to 72 hours of dota and WoW. :)

    I'm taking have Friday off, WOOT.

    You know, we still have moonbase commander, starcraft, Warcraft III, dawn
    of war, rise of nations, etc. We could spice it up by having a tournament
    with teams or solo. I think that could be really fun. We could also bring
    non-electronic games (gasp) like settlers of catan and the betrayal at the
    house on the hill and Entdecker.

Pysibal
    Also, I volunteer to help Seth out with tribes. Come on over (baby) Thurs
    afternoon for hot Tribes action?
