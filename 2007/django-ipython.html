        <p>I've gone a long time without doing any serious web programming because the thought of all the effort you have to put into building a PHP app has been too dispiriting. Web-frameworks sounded interesting, but my brief experience with the poster-child, Ruby on Rails (RoR), was bad. RoR generates a large directory structure which felt overly complicated. It also generates HTML and JavaScript for you which I did not like at all.</p>
        <p>Enter <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, the Web-framework for perfectionists with deadlines--it couldn't have been more tailored to my style of development if I had written it myself. In the past I had become interested in Python a number of times due to the sheer volume of decidedly <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3882">glowing testimonials</a> for the language. <a href="http://www.python.org/about/success/">All those testimonials</a> are smart--Python is gorgeous.</p>
        <p>So I dove right in and am currently in the middle of one medium- and one large-sized project. Unfortunately, I don't yet know much about Python or hardly anything about object oriented programming. If you are similarly inexperienced, I highly recommend installing IPython for all your <code>django- admin.py shell</code>-ing. Auto-complete for all Django's objects can be invaluable for finding what methods and (sub?)-objects are available to the object you're currently working with.</p>
        <p>I'll post more on Django later, and you can damn-well expect this blog to be replaced with something custom-built in the near future. In the meantime, many thanks to <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/faq/#who-s-behind-this">Django's creators</a> and the awesome Django community for gifting such an awesome web-development tool.</p>
