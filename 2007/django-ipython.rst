Learning Django with IPython
============================

I've gone a long time without doing any serious web programming because the
thought of all the effort you have to put into building a PHP app has been
too dispiriting. Web-frameworks sounded interesting, but my brief experience
with the poster-child, Ruby on Rails (RoR), was bad. RoR generates a large
directory structure which felt overly complicated. It also generates HTML and
JavaScript for you which I did not like at all.

Enter `Django`_, the Web-framework for perfectionists with deadlines--it
couldn't have been more tailored to my style of development if I had written
it myself. In the past I had become interested in Python a number of times
due to the sheer volume of decidedly `glowing testimonials`_ for the
language. `All those testimonials`_ are smart--Python is gorgeous.

So I dove right in and am currently in the middle of one medium- and one
large-sized project. Unfortunately, I don't yet know much about Python or
hardly anything about object oriented programming. If you are similarly
inexperienced, I highly recommend installing IPython for all your ``django-
admin.py shell``-ing. Auto-complete for all Django's objects can be
invaluable for finding what methods and (sub?)-objects are available to the
object you're currently working with.

I'll post more on Django later, and you can damn-well expect this blog to be
replaced with something custom-built in the near future. In the meantime,
many thanks to `Django's creators`_ and the awesome Django community for
gifting such an awesome web-development tool.
