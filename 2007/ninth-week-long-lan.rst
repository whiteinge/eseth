=====================================
Ninth Annual Week(end)-Long LAN Party
=====================================

Prepare yourselves for the Ninth Annual Week(end)-Long LAN Party!

It will be July 6-8th.


Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The head-count is nine people in total, which may drop to six or seven after
Friday. Friday night will be classic UT night since a few people are coming
out specifically for that. The rest of the party will be unstructured.

We will be starting early and ending early for a change; we'll probably go
from pre-noon until two in the morning (or so). For those of you not spending
the night, get the fuck up to my place in the A.M.! We'll have enough food
for lunch.


Food
::::

Complementary catering will be provided by Casa de los Casa. We'll have
barbecued chicken, potato salad, cold sandwiches, peanut butter, and frozen
burritos. Bring a few bucks for pizza on Friday night, and maybe one other
occasion (Saturday night?). Also, if you're so inclined, bring your own beer
(and maybe one for a friend).


Sleeping Arrangements
:::::::::::::::::::::

Bring a blankey (and a pillow, change of clothes, toothbrush, etc.). We'll
provide towels, and hidden cams for showering.


Equipment & Gaming Space
::::::::::::::::::::::::

I will provide internet, extension cables and ethernet cables, as usual.
Also, I have plenty of table space so just bring your shit and a comfy chair.
I have a bunch of chairs, but they're all of the metal-and-folding variety.

I have one television, if there's to be dual-consoling of any sort, I'll need
someone to bring another.

    This is all well and good, but i just read an article about a guy named
    Gary Feltch. Check it out on page B8 of Thursday's Tribune!

Captain Fish Clits
    If you play WoW, I'm sure the illustrious Luke will not be able to join in,
    since you'll all be doing level 70 stuff. Jerks.

    But maybe he won't be in town, anyway.

whiteinge
    Gatt, Beatty and I haven't done any post-60 stuff. Maybe something like a
    mass lowbie push would be fun. Like two three-or-four-man groups comprised
    entirely of Draenei Pallys (or something similar).

whiteinge
    There's gotta be a non-WoW game out there that's worth playing, but it
    seems that every single one of us is either out of the loop, or playing
    WoW. Quick! Everyone ask their nephews what all the cool kids are playing
    these days.

MILKM3PLZ
    So, I think that focusing on WoW isn't going to work super well. We
    probably aren't going to have a five people willing/able to do a 5 man
    group, esp. considering Gatt and Beatty don't play. I think we should kick
    it old school. Get some lava giant, get some facing worlds, get some Q3 DM,
    warcraft III (not that we've ever actually played it), DotA, look for some
    cools mods to the aformentioned games, smash bros, guitar hero, maybe
    something for the Wii, dawn of war (?), command and conquer 3 (?), rise of
    nations (?), moonbase commander (?), diablo II (sullivan/jason, im looking
    at you), tribes?I'm sure we won't all want to or be able to play the same
    stuff at the same time, so I think we shouldn't even worry about trying. We
    spend too much time trying to get everyone on the same page playing the
    same thing?with only a weekend, I say "fuck it." Let's just have a fun time
    hanging out and tandem gaming. I see nothing wrong with four people hitting
    Gnomregan while we have a person playing amplitude, a person watching
    amplitude, a couple of people pwning in DotA, and a couple people sparring
    in WCIII.

    That being said, I'd still like to - if possible - play CTF or DM with
    most/all of the participants at least once or twice. I just don't think
    making a huge effort to get everyone on the same thing is going to work or
    will be fun.

whiteinge
    I think James' suggestion is great. Also, the majority of us have chicks
    atm, so bring 'em if you got 'em (chicks dig consoles)! The more the
    merrier. (Previous statement updated for slightly less sexism.)

Joe
    Facing worlds is awesome. Do they have modern flush-toilets up there in
    Ogden? If they do we should try to fill the bowl up with piss.

Gatt
    Beatty is definately on the right track with the piss idea. In fact, let's
    forget the games and just drink coke and coffee for three days and see if
    we can fill the bathtub instead. Additionally I don't really like the idea
    of us all jacking off doing our own thing, it sort of takes away from the
    idea of the LAN party. I do see James's point and if we do tandem gamin
    I'll try not to be a little girl about it, I would just like to think of a
    way to get as many people on the same page as we can. Hopefully that will
    be taken care of because we will find a new game that is so awesome nobody
    wants to even think about anything else. I remembered that I have a friend
    at work who games a ton with his brothers over LAN and Jon also seems to
    keep up pretty well on this stuff, so I will check with both of them.

Jason
    I too do not play WoW. But, I will try to make an apearance this year. No
    school or work makes it easier.

Brandon
    I'd like to play: 1. Either starcraft or dawn of war. I've had an itch for
    some old school starcraft ever since Jason asked for my cd key, and I don't
    think we ever gave dawn of war a fair go. I think that if we play an RTS,
    it should be one of these two.

    1.  Tribes or one of the UTs. I thought tribes was awesome, but botless. If
        we are willing to take our sorry asses online, we should give it a go.
        If we don't want to humiliate ourselves against strangers, we should
        make ourselves feel good by beating a team of UT bots.
    2.  DotA. The all tiny match we did was cool, even though this game sucks.
    3.  Console stuff. I'll make sure that guitar hero is there, and I'd like
        to try out something for the wii.
    4.  Not WoW, at least if we can help it. I really don't want to start
        another alt, and we play it all the time anyway. If we really want to
        do an MMO, it might be fun to hop onto a trial of middle earth online
        (assuming they offer a trial, most MMOs do). That stint we did with the
        D&D MMO was a good time.

MILKM3PLZ
    I agree with most of the comments so far. I hope Gatt finds a game that's
    so fun everyone just wants to play it and nothing else because that's what
    makes LAN parties super stellar. Such a game is not always availible,
    however, as we've found in the past. If we want to all play the same thing,
    which I will agree is ideal but based on past experiences doesn't always
    happen, we need to set up a schedule for playing certain games at certain
    times or unanimously agree to make the LAN party about one game. People
    have found the idea of scheduling restrictive in the past, but LAN parties
    work better if everyone isn't a chaotic mob. I would agree that being a
    chaotic mob is fun if we all hop from game to game *together*
    spontaneously, but that hasn't really happened for years and I think we
    should not gamble on that. I don't feel that much, if anything, is taken
    away from the LAN party experience by organizing things.

    I'd like for console gaming to happen. GFs like it, and guitar hero and
    amplitude are popular. Since consoles are 1-4 players we may have to
    CONSOLE gatton, but I think the LAN party would be poorer without them.

    I really WANT to like dawn of war. I'd like to try that again, esp. if we
    can steal some expansions. Multiplayer starcraft is inferior to warcraft
    III, but I know that you pussies can't manage heroes effectively so I will
    happily zerg your faces. Also, my GF may play.

    I like UT! It's still fun, and I don't know why we ever put it down at
    LANs. LAVA GIANT FTW!

    I can make another DotA questionnaire, and we can play a limited number of
    matches with fun rules (all pudge, all tiny, all rikimaru, -ardmscnpmmduid,
    etc). I think that will satisfy the people who want to play DotA "for real"
    and the people who secretly like it but can't stand that they suck at it.

    Starting an MMO a la D&D online might be fun, but perhaps ONLY if it's D&D
    online. We already know how the game works, the rules, the strats, etc to
    some extent, and my concern is that if we play an another MMO we'll spend
    12 hours running around trying to figure out how to find our way out of
    town or open the quest log or equip our pants. I also enjoyed the way D&D
    online was presented and how the game worked. I think it would be a fun
    experience to play through that game for 8-16 hours with a static and
    balanced group. The disadvantage is that doing that would only be for a
    certain number of people and adding more later would probably be hard
    (quest pre-reqs, level reqs, etc). Also, we've already played through it
    for awhile before so it would take some of our very limited time to
    actually access new content. We could theoretically start single player
    accounts a week before (the trial is 10 days?) and get to level 4 or
    something, so we can start right off - maybe also read some strat guide so
    we aren't wasting time running around lost after we're done with the
    content we remember.

    WoW can suck it for the duration of this party.

MILKM3PLZ
    With apologies to Seth, here's another thing I want to mention as early as
    possible: most of us don't live in Ogden. In the absence of the traditional
    house, I want to try to find a place in SLC at which we can do this since
    most people live here. I know some people in my IT dept. do LANing, so I
    can ask them if we can use their space or if they have an unused building
    somewhere. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me to hold this party so far
    away from most of the participants unless we have to.

whiteinge
    With apologies to James, fuck your apology: none of you live in Ogden.

    Since we're gaming over a weekend instead of the traditional week, I felt a
    sleepover might be a good way to maximize time. If the sleepover is a no-go
    then driving to-and-from Ogden every day is silly. So what say you (all) to
    the sleepover?

MILKM3PLZ
    Myself, I don't want to sleep over. I don't tolerate alterations to my
    sleep patterns well and I think it would be a logistical ass-fest to manage
    contact lens, showering, toothbrushing, bedding, food, and People Awake
    Gaming vs. People Asleep. Jenn has a lot of friends at Xmission, maybe they
    can hook us up.

Matt
    Dang! I just missed the cutoff for the sleepover. Craptacular!

    On a serious note, has anyone played any XMP lately? I understand there is
    a mod for UT2k4 that does XMP, but I haven't followed its progress for
    ages. There should at least be some traditional LAN fragfest --all the
    better with vehicles of various kinds.

MILKM3PLZ
    What's XMP?

whiteinge
    Unreal II: Expanded Multiplayer http://www.free-monkey.com/main/utxmp.php

MILKM3PLZ
    I'm not sure if anyone besides Seth and I read this, anymore?

Thais
    Hello - For the ones who would stay and not cry at night, I'll make sure
    you are all well fed. We'll even toss some steak on the menu. I am
    accepting suggestions for the menu by the way. For the ones who would cry
    at night and need to sleep on their nice and soft bed, the ride to Ogden
    from downtown Salt Lake is just fine, it takes me 10 from downtown to the
    I-89 exit and 15 minutes from I-89 to our house. Since you guys are doing
    this on a weekend, there is no traffic. Please come, we are excited to have
    you guys over.

Joe
    Who the hell is Matt?

whiteinge
    Matt is an uber-cool friend, and once (and hopefully future) co- worker
    that I met while working with Carson's older brother (also uber- cool).

    Incidentally, I'm not one to respect laws that I personally find
    undesirable; if Nat and Matt were to show up for the LAN, I would not turn
    them in to the age-police?

whiteinge
    I don't know how much i like the "lets design this around GFs" idea. (Thais
    can come since its her house) They might like consoles, but its more of a
    "whee, that was a fun ten minutes" kind of like, then they will be hanging
    around and distracting from UT and we won't actually get any gaming
    accomplished. And the queef stench will be unbearable.

whiteinge
    Perhaps they can pepper their gaming spurts with excursions to the local
    discount shoe-shop, as well as chat amongst themselves in that
    high-pitched, super-velocity chick language while they make us sandwiches

Brandon
    Ok, to sum things up:

    This will be 7/06(friday) through 7/08(sunday). I'll likely be setting my
    stuff up on thursday, and I'd suggest that others do the same. Whoever
    shows up late friday, only to find out that they need to do major
    patching/harware fixing, owes $100 to each LANer that set up early.

    We'll be doing this at Seth's house in Ogden. Travel times will be a
    hassle, but not as bad as some have made it out to be. The main advantage
    is that Seth has total control of the building, and we can keep whatever
    hours we want. Sleepover sounds good to me, but if people don't want to do
    that, a half-hour drive each way isn't anything to worry about. Oh, and we
    get Thais catering service.

    For games, it seems like there is a good amount of interest in Dawn of War.
    If anybody wants to play online before the LAN party, that'd rock. I own
    the game, and the latest patch eliminates the CD check, so I can hook you
    up. FPS-wise, I think original UT is the way to go. Everybody's computer
    can handle it, and it was featured at our alltime best LAN parties.

Gatt
    Well it appears things are shaping up just as i had planned. James and Seth
    plan the LAN party with occasional input from Brandon and Beatty covers the
    jokes. Why did you need me to post?

whiteinge
    How the hell else would we know everything's on track if you didn't let us
    know, Gatt? Geez!

    Actually, we need you to handle the meat.

    I'd like to do a Brazilian barbecue once or maybe twice over the weekend.
    Maybe an expensive one that everyone chips in for (like last year) on
    Saturday, and a cheaper one on Sunday (ribs, or something).

    Think you can hook us up with some choice cuts of horse meat, Gatt?

MILKM3PLZ
    Hey, I can finally access this page. Joy. Maybe I can take that Friday off,
    too, and set up Thursday like my bestest friend in the whole world Brandon.

    I guess I'll stop trying to find a place to do this closer to SLC, since I
    seem to be largely reviled for trying to save time and cut down on
    logistical cocksmackery. How dare I.

    What's wrong with having consoles, again? I don't think any of our GF's
    like FPS's, but I think it will be fun to have them there.

    Yay Dawn of War. Please install it and patch it. If you all wait until the
    day of the LAN to install and patch with only Brandon's (and maybe Jason's)
    CD, we will never play games together because it takes awhile.

    BEFORE THE WEEK OF THE LAN, if you want to play WCIII, Dawn of War, Unreal
    Tournament (the first one), Diablo, Rise of Nations, Quake III, Starcraft,
    etc:

    1.  If you have the disk, please FIND the thing before you are about to
        leave for Ogden.
    2.  Please have the game installed.
    3.  Join an internet game, again and again, until you're done patching.
    4.  Test the game to make sure it runs with your video card, sound card,
        network card, playing card, yellow card, green card, nutsack card, etc.
        so we don't have to deal with that bullshit on LAN time. Actually play
        a game vs. the computer or something, don't just see if you can start a
        game.
    5.  Expect that relying on burned disks and boot disks may be chancey, and
        it may not work. --->If you lack disks and don't know people who have
        them, call around or post here so we can get you hooked up.

MILKM3PLZ
    Well, that's a solid brick of text. Too bad the spaces I put in there
    didn't work, and I can't edit my post. Suck it.

whiteinge
    I got your back with the formatting, yo. (The afore-mentioned reviling
    notwithstanding.) Not that anyone will follow your instructions, anyway.
    (Erik! That's you!)

MILKM3PLZ
    Yes, I'm sure Erik won't, because he is a pile of lame. So, Sullivan and I
    would really like to play WCIII (in addition to DotA) with other people at
    the party. Are any of you brave enough to learn how to play appreciate the
    game?

whiteingeh
    Why play WCIII when we could instead play an *actual* Blizzard RTS?

    j/k. I'm up for whatever. (And by "whatever" I'm referring to whatever
    genre WCIII is in.)

whiteinge
    RPG
    R
    T
    S

MILKM3PLZ
    If you (or anyone else) want to improve your WCIII skills and learn why you
    can't play it like StarCraft, I can help you with some easy ways to play
    better and get into the right mind frame. We can play a 1v1 or two against
    each other online, then 2v2 vs. comps, etc. I'm happy to provide that
    service. Same goes for Dawn of War, excluding Eldar and Orks.

Joe
    I want to play WCIII. can we play the "footies" map that pops up on the
    battlenet server listings?

Jose
    Todo me suena muy bien todav?a. Puedo coger la carne. Tuvimos backribs en
    la barbacoa de buen viaje y estaban muy ricos. ?Que mas carne quiere?
    ?Ribeye otra vez? O si prefieres, Seth, puedo matar un caballo de mis
    cumpa?eros de trabajo y traer esa carne. Thais, debes decir a tu perezoso
    esposo que ?l tenga que aprender portugues entonces el puede leer los
    mensajes de Jos? y tengo por lo menos alg?n idea lo que diga yo, sin pedir
    la ayuda tuya. Ademas joda WCIII en su culo.

whiteinge
    Google's highly accurate translation of the above comment:

        All it very well still sounds to me. I can take the meat. We had
        backribs in the barbecue of have a good travel and were very rich. That
        but meat it wants? Ribeye again? Or if you prefer, Seth, I can kill a
        horse of my cumpa?eros of work and bring that meat. Thais, you must say
        to your sluggish husband who he must learn then Portuguese can read the
        messages of Jose and I have some idea at least which says I, without
        requesting the aid yours. In addition joda WCIII in its ass.

MILKM3PLZ
    Footies is a map that is, I believe, designed to help people learn how to
    micro.

Joe
    what about the jurassic park map?

Jose
    To be honest, I?m impressed at how well that translation turned out. It was
    wrong a lot, but that was based on context and the back asswards spanish
    syntax, which made the whole thing sound pretty fucking funny. Also that
    tengo at the end should have been tener, my bad. Anyway, they gist was that
    I?ll bring meat, I just wondered what kind specifically you wanted, and
    suggested that "in the barbecue of have a good travel" we had some tasty
    backribs which we could get again. Dawn of War sounds more appealing to me
    than Warcraft III, because I already know that the AI sucks in WCIII and I
    hate playing against human opponents because it feels like such a
    monumental waste of time when I inevitably lose because I never play, as
    you can see it is a vicious cycle. But maybe I could have a good time in an
    5v5 game just building as many moonwells in hard to reach places as I can.
    Also if we wanted to have a 5 of us v 5 b-net nubs, that would be cool.

whiteinge
    Lets collect money for an expensive cut of meat--ala last year's bbq. We'll
    also pick up some cheap $20 pork ribs because we'll get a bit of mileage
    out of 'em.

    So, everyone pony up $10 or so for a slab of fantastic beef of Gatt's
    choosing.

MILKM3PLZ
    Every one is going to be on the same level for WCIII except Sullivan,
    myself, and Jason (level of proficiency listed in order). You shouldn't
    worry about sucking.

Joeh
    What if Rex comes? Isn't he good too? Although i doubt the transponder
    Kristen put on him extends all the way to Ogden?

MILKM3PLZ
    Rex is virtually semi-professional. He is the best of us, hands down. But
    he has no time and will not be coming, I'm guessing. If you want to know
    how to play the Orcs, Rex will give you more advice than you know what to
    do with.

+1 Luke of POWER!
    Yo!

    I'm back from Europe! (Almost!)

    I'm planning to be at this thing, and Lindsay wants to come and play Smash
    Brothers and Mario Kart (and then probably distract me). Dawn of War sounds
    cool, I suck at Warcraft III, D&D Online sounds cool, Diablo II sounds
    cool, I want to try some Wii games, I'll be disappointed if I don't play at
    least one rollicking dota match, I'll chip in for food, and I'll plan on
    making the commute between Ogden and SLC.

    Kisses to to you all.

MILKM3PLZ
    Dawn of War Platinum is out. You can get both xpax and the game for $40, or
    1 xpac and the game for $20 (gold edition).

whiteinge
    What's an xpax?

MILKM3PLZ
    xpax = expansion packs

whiteinge
    Oh.

    You kids and your interweb slang!

Matt
    Hehehehh?.he said interweb.

MILKM3PLZ
    So, Seth, now that this is imminent, I have a bunch of logistical
    questions. I can help you figure things out if you want to call me or
    something.

    How many people are going? And how crowded will your house be, and will it
    ventilation/temperature be a problem? Will it be too hot to sleep? Do we
    all need to bring chairs? Do we need to bring tables? Are your tables and
    chairs conducive to video gaming or are the tables really small or the
    chairs really angled back (etc)? Do those who are going to sleep over have
    space appropriate to their needs? Do you have enough food or a plan for how
    food will be handled, and if so, what is it exactly? Do we need to bring
    TVs for consoles or do we have enough (maybe we should figure out what
    "enough" is, too)? Is there space to comfortably play on consoles and
    computers while allowing walkways and space for people to scoot chairs back
    if they need to? Do we have enough outlets and cables for everyone, and do
    the cords stretch as far as they will need to?

    If I think of more potential issues we can nip in the bud, I'll post them.

whiteinge
    Thanks, James. I've updated the post to reflect this info.

MILKM3PLZ
    Lol, "boxen."

4ngryk0ng
    i can bring my tv if needed. it's an LCD screen, so it's light and movable,
    and will give us another tv to rot our brains with.

Jose Publico
    Hey guys, drop everything! I have found the answer to our LAN dilema. We
    will all play abbatia, at www.abbatia.net it?s a game in which you build a
    medieval monestary and tend to your monks, their animals and you try to
    copy and translate various religious texts. ?Que te aproveche! Co?os.

MILKM3PLZ
    Now's the time to get WCIII and Dawn of War installed.

Thais
    I recommend all to bring a comfortable chair. We've got plenty, but after a
    few hours it might hurt?unless if your butts are made of what Seth's butt
    is, (he can handle it --programmer's butt).

Thais
    Opss? didn't check the Equipment part? and Jose, voce deve dizer ao seu
    amigo Seth que ele tem que aprender portugues para que ele entenda o que
    estou dizendo quando estou falando mal da irma chata delej

whiteinge
    Thanks for offering the TV, Jason! I think that will really make the
    consoling.
    
MILKM3PLZ
    I'm thinking of fun party ideas, like little contests to determine who gets
    to choose the next "all hero X" dota game. Hopefully I'll come up with
    something fun. I plan on typing up another survey for the Dota On-going Nub
    Gauging System (DONGS), as well.
