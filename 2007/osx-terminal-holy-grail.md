The Mac OS X Terminal Holy Grail: mrxvt
=======================================

I\'ve been a bit unhappy with terminal offerings on OS X since I
switched. I\'ve spent a bit of time working with each iTerm, GLTerm,
xterm, aterm, eterm, but always end up back with Terminal.app because
it\'s fast and pretty. My wish list has always been speed and
anti-aliased fonts. I use Gnu screen for tabs and don\'t mind using X11
coming from a Unix background. Recently I added 256-color support to my
wish list which Terminal.app and xterm don\'t support (neither
X11.app\'s version or the MacPorts version have it compiled in).

I finally stumbled across
[mrxvt](http://materm.sourceforge.net/wiki/Main/Download). It supports
anti-aliased fonts, 256-colors and it\'s unbelievably fast! Eyeball the
screenshot below\--a 256-color terminal is *so* worth the effort\--this
is mrxvt running Gnu Screen running Vim.

Although I had to compile it myself, I had no issues with the following:
`./configure --enable-everything --disable-debug --disable-greek`.
(Install the `no_debug_x` patch if you\'re compiling mrxvt-0.5.2 or
it\'ll be very slow.)

I also added the following to my `.Xresources`:

    ! --- mrxvt settings
    mrxvt*background: black
    mrxvt*foreground: white
    mrxvt*scrollBar: false
    mrxvt*loginShell: true
    mrxvt*autohideTabbar: true
    mrxvt*syncTabTitle: true
    mrxvt*hideButtons: true
    mrxvt*cursorBlink: true
    mrxvt*font: Monaco
    mrxvt*faceSize: 11
    mrxvt*cursorColor: red
    mrxvt*xft:True
    mrxvt*xftFont: Monaco
    mrxvt*xftSize:12
    mrxvt*xftAntialias:True
    mrxvt*termName: xterm-256color
    ! blue is usually too dark to see. this fixes that
    mrxvt*color4: RoyalBlue
    mrxvt*color12: RoyalBlue

The Gnu Screen from MacPorts is already compiled with 256-color support
so putting the following in my .screenrc was the last step:

    ###############
    # 256 colours #
    ###############
    #
    #.. __: http://frexx.de/xterm-256-notes/
    #

    # terminfo and termcap for nice 256 color terminal
    # allow bold colors - necessary for some reason
    attrcolor b ".I"
    # tell screen how to set colors. AB=background, AF=foreground
    termcapinfo xterm 'Co#256:AB=\E[48;5;%dm:AF=\E[38;5;%dm'
    # erase background with current bg color
    defbce "on"

:   Does something special have to be done to allow mrxvt to see Mac OS
    X fonts? I just got my first Apple, and compiling mrxvt and using
    the .Xresources you've provided leaves me with the error messages:

    mrxvt: can't load font "Monaco" mrxvt: Could not open file
    default.menu

    If this works, I'll be very grateful. iTerm is noticeably slow.

    Thanks!

whiteinge

:   Not sure about that one, Ardekantur. I have fontconfig via MacPorts
    installed, so maybe that's it---but if so, I never manually ran or
    configured it. Have you tried re-creating your font-cache fc-cache?

    One other thing to check is, I seem to recall some path problem with
    fonts being in a few different places on OS X. I've seen suggestions
    that you create a /etc/X11/XftConfig file with the following:

        dir "/System/Library/Fonts"
        dir "/Library/Fonts"
        dir "~/Library/Fonts"

    Then restart X. But I didn't have that file on my system...

    Drop another comment if any of these suggestion do or don't pan out.

Ardekantur

:   No luck, I'm afraid. It's strange, though - mrxvt for me is in
    /usr/local/bin, and even if that path is set in both my .profile and
    .bash\_login, X11 refuses to start a terminal that has that path.
    Maybe there's some overreaching path problem with X11 and it not
    being able to find things.

Ardekantur

:   Got it! I think I had to install fontconfig first, and then rebuild
    mrxvt. Thanks for your help!

whiteinge

:   Awesome! Thanks for the update. I'll have to research fontconfig now
    a bit...

P.Gr.

:   This has been the most helpful guide to mrxvt on Mac OS X I have
    found. Great work! I just have one question. I have installed mrxvt,
    macports, and fontconfig and all of that works. Now I would like to
    add one more feature - how do I get window transparency working in
    mrxvt? If I type 'mrxvt -o 25' it creates a plain opaque window. I'm
    kind of a Unix noob, do I need Xcompmgr or something (and if so, how
    do I install it)?

whiteinge Says:

:   To the best of my knowledge there is no way to get actual
    transparency in Apple's X11.app because it requires XFree86 6.8 with
    transparency support built-in. Apple appears to be running XFree86
    4.4 still and I've only heard rumors about X11 updates for
    Leopard.[^1]

    Apparently you can get pseudo-transparency working, but I couldn't
    get it to work very reliably. Pseudo-transparency, just in case
    you're not familiar with it, is setting an X11 background image (you
    can see it if you enter X11.app's full-screen mode), then the
    terminal program (usually Eterm, aterm, or mrxvt) fakes transparency
    by displaying the part of the background image that it's covering in
    it's own window. It's an interesting hack, and it helps to see it in
    action to understand what it's doing.

    If you want to try pseudo-transparency, use MacPorts to install
    Eterm, then try `Esetroot -f /path/to/your/background/image.jpg`
    then start up `Eterm`. I stopped trying to get it to work with mrxvt
    though since I couldn't get the background image to stop changing by
    itself. :-(

P.Gr. Says:

:   Cool, I got pseudo-transparency working. I like the effect. I added
    Esetroot to my .xinitrc file, it seems to load the background image
    correctly and consistently display the right one with mrxvt. Wish I
    knew how to fix your background image problem.

    Terminal 2 looks nice. Here's hoping they add 256-colors...

duckpond Says:

:   One of my office machine has the xterm-256color entry in
    /usr/share/terminfo/78/, but in my newly build osx86, I don't see
    ther terminfo xterm-256color anywhere, so I am guessing maybe I
    should install or upgrade some package to have that particular
    terminfo? what package should I reinstall?

whiteinge Says:

:   You can try copying the xterm-256color file from one computer to the
    other. That worked for me for a while with screen-256color until
    MacPorts updated their GNU screen package.

    In direct answer to your question: it appears that the
    xterm-256color file belongs to the ncurses package in MacPorts
    (ncursesw). (I'm not sure about Fink.)

duckpond Says:

:   mrxvt install was a success, vim and emacs can all work on 256
    colors mode. for emacs, the xterm-256color.el was not there by
    default, you'll need to drop a copy to the \$EMACS\_HOME/lisp/term/
    directory.

    also installed ncursesw via MacPorts (now called DarwinPorts?), and
    terminfo for xterm-256color were installed by the package. I tried:

    TERM=xterm-256color vim

    just in the regular Terminal.app, vim then gave me a blinking
    screen, is the terminfo can only be recognized by X11 applications?

    thanks,

:   NO UTF8 SUPPORT? Thats is unacceptable for me in 21st century
    computing. You should note that somewhere in your article, as I took
    it for granted and spent a bunch of time setting mrxvt in my system
    only to find out it lacks UTF8 support.

whiteinge Says:

:   It's a fair complaint; I am also looking forward to unicode support
    in mrxvt. Although I think it is a mistake to take unicode support
    for granted in a terminal environment. There is so much legacy code
    out there, it will be a long while still before command-line unicode
    becomes commonplace. For example, I see command-line encoding
    problems almost daily as I work (as a web developer) --- even when
    using Terminal.app or other UTF-aware terminals.

[^1]: Side note, I just stumbled across Terminal 2 on Apple's site. That
    should be interesting to see in November.
