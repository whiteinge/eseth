The Mac OS X Terminal Holy Grail: mrxvt
=======================================

I've been a bit unhappy with terminal offerings on OS X since I
switched. I've spent a bit of time working with each iTerm, GLTerm,
xterm, aterm, eterm, but always end up back with Terminal.app because
it's fast and pretty. My wish list has always been speed and
anti-aliased fonts. I use Gnu screen for tabs and don't mind using X11
coming from a Unix background. Recently I added 256-color support to my
wish list which Terminal.app and xterm don't support (neither
X11.app's version or the MacPorts version have it compiled in).

I finally stumbled across
[mrxvt](http://materm.sourceforge.net/wiki/Main/Download). It supports
anti-aliased fonts, 256-colors and it's unbelievably fast! Eyeball the
screenshot below--a 256-color terminal is *so* worth the effort--this
is mrxvt running Gnu Screen running Vim.

Although I had to compile it myself, I had no issues with the following:
`./configure --enable-everything --disable-debug --disable-greek`.
(Install the `no_debug_x` patch if you're compiling mrxvt-0.5.2 or
it'll be very slow.)

I also added the following to my `.Xresources`:

    ! --- mrxvt settings
    mrxvt*background: black
    mrxvt*foreground: white
    mrxvt*scrollBar: false
    mrxvt*loginShell: true
    mrxvt*autohideTabbar: true
    mrxvt*syncTabTitle: true
    mrxvt*hideButtons: true
    mrxvt*cursorBlink: true
    mrxvt*font: Monaco
    mrxvt*faceSize: 11
    mrxvt*cursorColor: red
    mrxvt*xft:True
    mrxvt*xftFont: Monaco
    mrxvt*xftSize:12
    mrxvt*xftAntialias:True
    mrxvt*termName: xterm-256color
    ! blue is usually too dark to see. this fixes that
    mrxvt*color4: RoyalBlue
    mrxvt*color12: RoyalBlue

The Gnu Screen from MacPorts is already compiled with 256-color support
so putting the following in my .screenrc was the last step:

    ###############
    # 256 colours #
    ###############
    #
    #.. __: http://frexx.de/xterm-256-notes/
    #

    # terminfo and termcap for nice 256 color terminal
    # allow bold colors - necessary for some reason
    attrcolor b ".I"
    # tell screen how to set colors. AB=background, AF=foreground
    termcapinfo xterm 'Co#256:AB=\E[48;5;%dm:AF=\E[38;5;%dm'
    # erase background with current bg color
    defbce "on"
