        <h1 id="rest-for-markdown-and-textile-users">ReST for Markdown and Textile Users</h1>
        <p>ReStructuredText is freaking huge so users of lighter-weight markup languages can be easily put off. This is an <em>absolute basics</em> quickref to ReST for those kinds of users. Eye-ball the <a href="rest-for-markdown-and-textile-users.html#closing">Closing</a> at the bottom for a bit more perspective.</p>
        <h2 id="headers">Headers</h2>
        <p>Just use non-alphanumeric characters to underline (or under-and-overline) your heading. It doesn't matter what you use, just be consistent with the character you use for each header level:</p>
        <pre><code>=========
        Chapter 1
        =========
        
        Section 1.1
        ===========
        
        Section 1.2
        -----------
        
        Section 1.3
        +++++++++++
        
        =========
        Chapter 2
        =========</code></pre>
        <h2 id="text-styles">Text Styles</h2>
        <p><em>italics</em>: <code>*Italics*</code></p>
        <p><strong>bold</strong>: <code>**bold**</code></p>
        <p>Block quotes are just:</p>
        <p>&gt; Indented paragraphs, &gt; &gt;&gt; and they may nest.</p>
        <p>Use double backticks for inline code blocks like &quot; <code>this example where otherwise *special characters* aren't processed</code> &quot;. Dig?</p>
        <pre><code>::
        
            A paragraph containing only two colons (or ending in two colons)
            followed by an indented text block starts a code block.  No
            ReST processing will happen in this block, so feel free to use
            funny characters. `!@#$%^&amp;*()_+</code></pre>
        <h2 id="links">Links</h2>
        <p>ReST will automatically hyperlink any bare URLs.</p>
        <p>Inline hyperlinks can be somewhat hard to read <a href="http://the-meaning-of-life.info/">like this</a> surrounded by text:</p>
        <pre><code>Inline hyperlinks can be somewhat hard to read `like this &lt;http
        ://the-meaning-of-life.info/&gt;`_ surrounded by text.</code></pre>
        <p>Fortunately reference-style links <a href="http://the-universe-and-everything.info/">look</a> very legible in text-format. And can even <a href="http://yourockthepartythatrocksthebody.com">span multiple words</a> (like you would expect!):</p>
        <pre><code>Fortunately reference-style links look_ very legible in text-format.
        And can even `span multiple words`_ (like you would expect!).
        
        .. _span multiple words: http://yourockthepartythatrocksthebody.com
        .. _look: http://the-universe-and-everything.info/</code></pre>
        <h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>
        <p>Syntax:</p>
        <pre><code>#. Lists are a bit trickier in ReST
        #. than in Markdown or Textile
        
        #. Place a blank line
        #. between sub-lists
        
           #.   And line the bullet up
           #.   exactly with the farthest left column of text of the parent
                list
        
        * Unordered lists work in
          exactly the same way
        
        * Just be careful to line the bullets
          up with the first text column of the parent list.
        
          Also, you can do multi-line bullet items if you&#39;re
          careful of the indentation.
        
         Definition Lists are easy
            Just indent the definition!</code></pre>
        <h2 id="images">Images</h2>
        <p>You can easily include images, along with some useful attributes (carefully line up subsequent lines with the parent!):</p>
        <pre><code>.. image:: http://path/to/image.png
           :alt: alternate text
           :class: class names</code></pre>
        <h2 id="tables">Tables</h2>
        <p>Banging out simple tables is also very quick:</p>
        <pre><code>=====  =====  ======
           Inputs     Output
        ------------  ------
          A      B    A or B
        =====  =====  ======
        False  False  False
        True   False  True
        False  True   True
        True   True   True
        =====  =====  ======</code></pre>
        <h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
        <p>If this quickref peaked your interest hit up the <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">ReST specification</a>. It's not very easy to read, but it's worth it. You can use alternate syntaxes for marking-up lists, for example. There are many built-in mechanisms for marking-up meta data such as for HTML &lt;meta&gt; tags. There's a robust footnote and citation syntax. ReST generates references to key elements in your document so you can link to them. Docutils' <code>rst2html.py</code> can start numbering headings at any level so you can seamlessly fit ReST docs into your site hierarchy.</p>
        <p>The reason ReST is preferable to Markdown or Textile is that it <em>can</em> be written as simply as the lighter-weight markup languages if you're working on simple docs---but it doesn't have to be. You may appreciate that down the road when you find you suddenly need one of your docs in PDF or XML format.</p>
