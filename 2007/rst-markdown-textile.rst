I used to be a huge Textile fanboy. It took quite a bit to drag me (kicking
and screaming) to another lightweight markup language. I now use
RestructuredText for a `variety of reasons`_. The main reason I stuck with
Textile so long is because the output produces such `awesome typographic
niceties`_.

In this modern day is it really the job of a lightweight markup language to
do ASCII-to- (either) HTML-entity or above-ASCII character substitutions?
Certainly, there's quite a historical precedent; Latex has has done
typographic-appropriate character substitution for years. Certainly also,
it's sometimes nice to have the option for things you know aren't going to
have proper character encoding like blog comments (lay-people don't care, and
why should they?). But other times maybe this is something that can be easily
done just by knowledgeable people writing in UTF-8 and you shouldn't have to
rely on a tool to try and do it for you.

I've been thinking a lot about this on-and-off, and would love to see other
technical thoughts in the comments. (``(M|N)att?``, that's you!) Is anyone
out there writing in UTF-8 and putting in the proper punctuation as you go
(or using an editor/word-processor that does UTF-8)? Or is it just too much
of a pain in the ass? Is it less of a pain if you're not using an American
keyboard? (I don't know.)
