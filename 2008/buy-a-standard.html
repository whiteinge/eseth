        <p>If anyone else out there is stunned that yesterday's ISO approval of Microsoft's OOXML document format was not an April Fool's joke, James Hogarth has an excellent recap of the entire saga entitled <a href="http://www.tideway.com/community/blog-post/how-to-buy-a-standard-in-10-days/">How to buy a standard in 10 days</a>.</p>
        <p>Unfuckingbelievable. Here's hoping countries raise formal protests; if not, office document formats will remain incompatible for the foreseeable future.</p>
