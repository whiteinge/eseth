        <h1 id="pimping-out-your-.pythonrc.py">Pimping out your .pythonrc.py</h1>
        <p>I don't wanna be hatin' on <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/">IPython</a>, but I don't use it. I often favor fairly extreme minimalism in computing. Why install something if you can accomplish the same (or good enough) with what you have available? IPython has quite a lot of features and syntactic-sugar, but it is overkill for my needs. Instead I've been slowly crafting my <a href="https://github.com/whiteinge/dotfiles/blob/master/.pythonrc.py">pythonrc.py</a> to give the built-in Python shell color, tab completion, saving and searching a history, pretty printing, and the ability to start an external editor.</p>
        <p>It should be said that this code is not especially interesting, and a lot of this is very straightforward readline configuration -- but it seems that a lot of people are unfamiliar with the basics, so here is my set up.</p>
        <p>There are two parts. The <a href="https://github.com/whiteinge/dotfiles/blob/master/.inputrc">inputrc</a> sets up the key-bindings and some completion options, and the <a href="https://github.com/whiteinge/dotfiles/blob/master/.pythonrc.py">pythonrc.py</a> which does the rest.</p>
        <p>You will almost certainly want to strip things out of my <a href="https://github.com/whiteinge/dotfiles/blob/master/.inputrc">inputrc</a> that you don't use or enjoy, like vi-mode. Note the conditional for Python in case you want any key-bindings specific to the Python shell.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/whiteinge/dotfiles/blob/master/.inputrc">inputrc</a> should be somewhat self-explanatory. For the options that aren't check out the <a href="http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/bashref/ReadlineInitFileSyntax.html">GNU Bash Reference Manual</a>. Also Google is your friend. For example if you want to use page-up and page-down to do completion from your history use the following two commands:</p>
        <pre><code>&quot;\e[5~&quot;: history-search-backward
        &quot;\e[6~&quot;: history-search-forward</code></pre>
        <p>Now you can type in the first few characters of a previous command, hit your <code>history-search-backward</code> key and, voila, you get the full command. You can also search your history for a pattern using the normal keys for that -- for vi-mode hit <code>esc</code> to get in Normal mode then press <code>?</code> followed by the search term. (I don't know the search command for the regular Emacs shell mode.)</p>
        <p>A very cool thing about the <a href="https://github.com/whiteinge/dotfiles/blob/master/.inputrc">inputrc</a> is it will also affect other programs that utilize readline, such as bash and the shells for SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL.</p>
        <p>In order for the Python shell to run your <a href="https://github.com/whiteinge/dotfiles/blob/master/.pythonrc.py">pythonrc.py</a> file on startup you need to set the <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> environment variable. Place the following line in one of your shell startup files:</p>
        <pre><code>export PYTHONSTARTUP=$HOME/.pythonrc.py</code></pre>
        <p>Now run the Python shell and you should see color and some startup messages!</p>
        <p>If you are a Django developer and <code>DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE</code> exists in your environment, it will import all the models in your project and set up the Django test environment automatically. Try it!</p>
        <h2 id="lastly-a-few-python-shell-tips">Lastly a few Python shell tips</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>A great way to introspect an unfamiliar object is to type the object name followed by a dot then hit <code>tab</code>. You will see the methods and attributes for that object.</li>
        <li><p>You can get the output from the last command run with the variable <code>_</code> (underscore). For example:</p>
        <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; {1:2, 3:4}
        {1: 2, 3: 4}
        &gt;&gt;&gt; t = _
        &gt;&gt;&gt; t
        {1: 2, 3: 4}</code></pre></li>
        <li><p>Use the built-in <code>help()</code> method to get more info on a function or module. For example:</p>
        <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import os
        &gt;&gt;&gt; help(os)
        Help on module os:
        ...</code></pre></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have any other tips or fixes, please let me know!</p>
